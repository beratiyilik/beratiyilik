# Welcome to Berat's GitHub - Engineer | Developer | Innovator | Builder

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Berat, a passionate Computer Engineer currently working as a Full-Stack Software Developer based in London. My journey in tech is driven by a deep-seated curiosity and an unwavering dedication to building solutions that matter.

With a robust foundation in both C# and JavaScript, I navigate through the complexities of software development with ease. My toolkit is rich with experience in the .NET and Node.js ecosystems, and I have a particular fondness for bringing ideas to life using React and Angular. 

Beyond the frameworks, I leverage AWS cloud technologies to architect and deploy scalable, resilient applications. Continuous learning is my mantra, and I'm always exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance my craft.

Whether it's through collaborative projects or individual endeavors, my goal is to contribute meaningful, innovative solutions to the digital landscape. Let's connect and create something remarkable together.
